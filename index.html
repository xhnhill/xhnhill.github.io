    <h2>Extra SELECTED SCHOOL PROJECTS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Codebrew Hackathon (2022)</strong>: Virtual Carbon Market Application</li>
      Team Leader of the project, with 3 teammates.
      Develop virtual carbon market application and win the first prize of Carbon and Energy Track
      Use Spring boot framework to set up the project and MySQL database to build up relational models.
      Redis is utilized to develop a realtime ranking list for app users/ organizations.

      <li><strong>Distributed Key-Value Store Based on Raft(2022)</strong></li>
      As the main developer, develops a distributed key-value database, which has strong consistency.
      Implement a raft layer, which helps to achieve consensus among different nodes
      Implement log compaction and snapshot functionality, which reduces the server memory load and helps
      lagging node to catch up quickly.

      <li><strong>Develop Distributed WhiteBoard (2022.8)</strong></li>
      Role: Team Leader, with one teammate
      This distributed whiteboard supports clients share real time drawing, which allows drawing and resizing
      basic shapes and supports free hand drawing.
      Design the GUI of the whole application and the architecture of the backend.
      Design and implement asynchronous communication protocol between clients and server, which uses
      Netty to achieve high performance.
      Use Kafka to store messages.

      <li><strong>Develop Peer-to-Peer file sharing system(2022.7)</strong></li>
      Role: Team Leader, with one teammate
      Develop the backend of the peer-to-peer file sharing system.
      Design a cache layer to avoid frequent disk reads for hot spot file
      Design multi threads architecture to achieve high transferring performance, which allows client to share
      and receive multiple files together
    </ul>

    <h2>RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</h2>

    School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University (July 2017-January 2018)
    Research assistant, Advisor: Prof. Tian Wang
    Tiny and dense targets detection in aerial images
    Accessed the performance of recent objection methods like RFCN,SSD
    Traced the development of object detection methods, mainly focused on RCNN, Fast RCNN, SPPNet as well as RFCN
    Published Robust Object Detection for Tiny and Dense Targets in VHR Aerial Images as first author in CAC2017, and was indexed in EI recently.
    Detection in human key points
    Traced the latest papers in human keypoint detection
    Coded the whole detection system according to the paper Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation using
    Part Affinity Fields.
    Proposed using a deconvolution method to compact the architecture and enhance the calculating speed.

    Institute of Computer Science & Technology of Peking University(May 2018-September 2018)
    Research assistant, Advisor: Prof. Yongtao Wang
    Rapid object detection in video sequences
    Re-implemented current state-of-art paper in object detection of video sequences.
    Developed new models which combined 3-d convolution blocks to accelerate inference speed.
    Research in Model compression
    Re-implemented Mobile Net, Shuffle Net as well as their advanced version and analyzed their performance
    on cifar-10 and ImageNet.

    AI Institute, New Oriental Education & Technology Group(September 2018-December 2018)
    Algorithm Intern
    Similarity evaluation in intelligent story machine
    Investigated the need of the product and evaluated the limit of required accuracy and speed.
    Tested traditional method like SIFT.
    Proposed to use neural network to approximate the encoding function, which encoded similar images into
    neighboring numbers while different images into distant numbers. Triplet loss were introduced to train the
    model.
    Finished a prototype of intelligent machine, which held an accuracy of 87% when distinguish similar images.
